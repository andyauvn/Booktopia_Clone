## üíæ Database Schema (MongoDB Models)

This section details the primary data models used in the application. We utilize a **NoSQL** structure optimized for speed and flexibility, managed through Mongoose schemas on the server.

| Model | Purpose | Key Fields (Enhanced) | Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | Stores auth, profile, and security tokens. | `name`, `email`, **`password` (hashed)**, **`permissions`** (array), **`wishlist`** (ref Book), `resetPasswordToken` | Has many **Orders** |
| **Book** | Core product catalog, pricing, and specs. | `title`, `author`, `slug`, **`fullPrice`**, **`discountPrice`**, **`costPrice`**, `stockCount`, `categories` (array), **`format`**, **`eBookFileUrl`** | Has many **OrderItems** and **Reviews** |
| **Review** | User-submitted ratings and comments. | `user` (ref User), `book` (ref Book), `rating` (1-5), `comment`, **`isApproved`** (for moderation) | Belongs to **User** and **Book** |
| **Order** | Tracks customer purchases. | `user` (ref User), `orderItems` (embedded), `totalPrice`, **`paymentResult`**, **`trackingNumber`**, `status` | Belongs to **User** |
| **OrderItem** | Details of books within a specific order. | `book` (ref Book), `quantity`, `priceAtPurchase` | Belongs to **Order** |

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Management & Development Process

This project was managed using an **Agile-like workflow** and visualized using **GitHub Projects** to maintain focus and prioritize feature development. Development strictly followed a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.

### **Development Workflow Highlights:**

* **TDD Cycle:** **Red-Green-Refactor** was used to ensure all business logic (validation, pricing, stock) and API endpoints are fully tested before deployment.
* **Task Management:** A **GitHub Project board** (Kanban style) was used to track features, bugs, and tasks, moving them through `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done` columns.
* **Version Control:** **Git** and **GitHub** were used for source control, following a feature-branch workflow.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Since this project has critical user and financial data, a comprehensive testing approach is implemented.

### 1. Unit Testing (Focus: Business Logic & Security)
* **Tools:** **Jest**
* **Key Tests:** Mongoose Schema validation (e.g., non-negative prices, required fields), **Password hashing logic**, User authorization methods, utility functions.

### 2. Integration Testing (Focus: API Endpoints & Data Flow)
* **Tools:** **Jest** and **Supertest**
* **Key Tests:**
    * **Order Flow:** User purchase sequence (‚Üí stock decrement ‚Üí order creation ‚Üí price calculation).
    * **Permission Checks:** Access control for Admin-only routes (e.g., `/api/admin/books`).
    * **Review Integration:** Verifying new reviews correctly update the book's cached `rating` and `numReviews`.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Focus: User Workflow)
* **Tools:** **Cypress** or **Playwright**
* **Key Tests:** Full user journey ("Happy Path"), user authentication/logout, cart persistence, and handling of failure states (e.g., out-of-stock items, bad login).
