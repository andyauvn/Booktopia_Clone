## üíæ Database Schema (MongoDB Models)

This section details the primary data models used in the application. We utilize a **NoSQL** structure optimized for speed and flexibility, managed through Mongoose schemas on the server.

| Model | Purpose | Key Fields (Simplified) | Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | Stores user authentication and profile data. | `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (`user` or `admin`), `wishlist` | Has many **Orders** |
| **Book** | Core product catalog data. | `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `price`, ``stockQuantity``, `category`, `description` | Has many **OrderItems** |
| **Order** | Tracks customer purchases. | `user` (ref **User**), `orderItems` (ref **OrderItem**), `totalPrice`, `status` (`pending`, `shipped`, `delivered`), `shippingAddress` | Belongs to **User** |
| **OrderItem** | Details of books within a specific order. | `book` (ref **Book**), `quantity`, `priceAtPurchase` | Belongs to **Order** |

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Management & Development Process

This project was managed using an **Agile-like workflow** and visualized using **GitHub Projects** to maintain focus and prioritize feature development.

### **Development Workflow Highlights:**

* **Task Management:** A **GitHub Project board** (Kanban style) was used to track features, bugs, and tasks, moving them through `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done` columns.
* **Version Control:** **Git** and **GitHub** were used for source control, following a feature-branch workflow.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Since this project has critical user and financial data, a comprehensive testing approach is recommended, covering the following areas:

### 1. Unit Testing (Focus: Business Logic)

* **Tools:** **Jest** (for Node.js/Express and React)
* **What to Test:**
    * **Backend:** Validation logic (e.g., ensuring book prices are positive), stock decrement/increment logic, user authentication middleware.
    * **Frontend:** Simple utility functions, custom React hooks, and component props rendering correctness.

### 2. Integration Testing (Focus: API Endpoints)

* **Tools:** **Supertest** (for Express/Node.js)
* **What to Test:**
    * **Order Flow:** Test the complete sequence: user adds book $\rightarrow$ stock decreases $\rightarrow$ order is created $\rightarrow$ payment is processed (simulated).
    * **Admin Permissions:** Ensure non-admin users cannot access routes like `/api/admin/add-stock`.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Focus: User Workflow)

* **Tools:** **Cypress** or **Playwright**
* **What to Test:**
    * **The "Happy Path":** Full user journey from landing page $\rightarrow$ searching for a book $\rightarrow$ adding to cart $\rightarrow$ logging in $\rightarrow$ checkout $\rightarrow$ viewing the successful order status.
    * **Failure States:** Test login with bad credentials, attempting to add an out-of-stock book, and cart manipulation.
